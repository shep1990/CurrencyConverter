# CurrencyConverter
Currency Converter Application

The migrations are configured in the startup.cs of the project, so all you have to do is run the application to migrate the database. 
Once the application is running then you'll have the ability to convert an amount into the selected currency. The application utilises the 
Fixer.io api to convert the amount, when the conversion is complete a log is created of the activity.
